The sessions are run in Victoria Hall Methodist Church, using the entrance on George Street for access (see &#8220;Our Location&#8221; for a map and directions). From 1.30 pm onwards, we run a tea/coffee bar with biscuits and cup-of-soups available. Guests are also able to chat among themselves or with volunteers, read books &amp; newspapers and play board games or snooker. At 2.00 pm a two-course hot lunch is served, prepared on site by our volunteer kitchen team. Our sessions close at 4.00 pm.</span><br><br><br></p>",
