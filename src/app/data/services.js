          "description": "<p><b>Covid-19 Update - 11th May 2020</b></p><p><b>COVID-19, Workers' Rights, and the Return to Work</b></p><p><b>Should you be at work?</b></p><p><span>It is still the case that those who can work from home should continue to do so. General bars, restaurants etc shouldn't be re opening unless they are doing a takeaway service.</span></p><p><span>Advice from the government about who should and shouldn't be at work has been a bit confusing but as of the week commencing 10 May&#160; supermarket workers, manufacturing workers, laboratory and research workers, construction workers, and those in delivery and distribution should be working. A lot of people in these sectors have already been working through the crisis anyway, but this will result in more people going back.</span><br></p><p>If your employer is using the furlough scheme and has furloughed you they should not be asking you to do any work. You're either on furlough or you aren't. They might require you to do training &#8211; guidance on this seems a bit ambiguous.</p><p><b>What are your employers' responsibilities?</b></p><p>Employers have a lot of legal responsibilities under various health and safety laws including</p><p>* The general responsibility to provide a safe working environment<br>* The responsibility to provide adequate personal protective equipment (PPE)<br>* The responsibility to carry out risk assessments<br>* The obligation to consult their workers on health and safety issues</p><p>If you have a recognised union in your workplace make sure you have elected some Health &amp; Safety Reps. Employers should share the results of risk assessments with these reps and consult with them. These reps can also carry out their own risk assessments and conduct inspections of workplaces to identify hazards and threats to health and safety.</p><p>Even if you don't have a union there is still provision in law to be consulted by employers about health and safety.</p><p>Case law seems to suggest that health and safety risk assessments also apply to travelling to and from work so bear this in mind if you have to use public transport.</p><p>Section 44 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 gives employees the right to refuse to work if they believe doing so would pose a 'serious and imminent danger' to health. This is an individual right and you cannot lawfully be penalised for exercising it &#8211; for example if your employer sacked you for exercising this right it would automatically be an unlawful dismissal. It is a right based on your sincerely held opinion, regardless of what your employer thinks. So even if they say &#8220;Well we've implemented X,Y, and Z,&#8221; that doesn't matter, if you believe that a 'serious and imminent danger' exists. Please see this blog from the Trades Union Congress for more information <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/can-i-refuse-work-because-coronavirus-we-explain-your-rights\" target=\"\">here.</a></p><p>If you are having problems with safty at work you can report to the Health and Safety Executive<span>&#160;by telephone on <a href=\"tel:03007906787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">0300 790 6787</a>. Lines&#160;are open Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 10pm.</span><br><br> Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh is also willing to discuss concerns and report anonymously on your behalf, see <a href=\"https://www.louisehaigh.org.uk/news/2020/05/13/keeping-workers-safe/\" target=\"\">here</a>.</p><p>All employees also have a general responsibility not to put themselves or anyone else in danger.</p><p>Make sure your managers are aware of these rights and responsibilities because unless your company head office has told them, they probably won't be. Managers should be aware that in some cases they can end up liable for breaches of health and safety law (as can employees).</p><p><b>What are workers asking for?</b></p><p>Groups of workers across the country and around the world have called for various things including:</p><p>* Maintaining physical distancing in workplaces, or using barriers (e.g. plexiglass guards) where this isn't possible<br>* COVID-19 tests for workers or, where this isn't available, temperature tests to check if anyone is running a fever<br>* Full pay for those off sick/isolating &#8211; this is a health and safety issue as there will no doubt be people that go to work ill if they would otherwise not be paid their full wage<br>* Extra steps to protect workers that fall into one or more of the vulnerable categories (including pregnant workers)</p><p>Remember that legal requirements should be treated as a minimum. When it comes to sick pay, health and safety measures (and indeed anything else) we should be demanding more than the bare minimum to keep ourselves, our colleagues, and the public safe. Check your contract of employment as it may contain clauses that go beyond the legal minimum.</p><p>Most importantly - get together with your colleagues and talk about whether you are happy with the measures your employer is taking. You will always be stronger acting together than alone. Join a union if you are not already in one and encourage your colleagues to do so.

Our main aim is to provide hot food and drinks, yet we also offer our guests a genuine welcome and the chance to socialise with others as they wish. The sessions are run in Victoria Hall Methodist Church, using the entrance on George Street for access (see &#8220;Our Location&#8221; for a map and directions). From 1.30 pm onwards, we run a tea/coffee bar with biscuits and cup-of-soups available. Guests are also able to chat among themselves or with volunteers, read books &amp; newspapers and play board games or snooker. At 2.00 pm a two-course hot lunch is served, prepared on site by our volunteer kitchen team. Our sessions close at 4.00 pm.</span><br><br><br></p>",

They will be able to help with National Insurance Numbers, applying for benefits, work and housing.

People will usually be invited to attend a JobCentre Plus office for an interview: an interpreter may be arranged if asked for in advance, but people can take their own interpreters.

This can happen at any time, but there are several points in the asylum and immigration process when people are more likely to be detained :-</p><ul><li>when first entering the UK</li><li>when claiming asylum, if the Home Office categorise the case as a Dublin safe third country case, or as a non-suspensive appeals case. This will happen after the screening interview.</li><li>if the person has claimed asylum, been refused and is &#34;appeal rights exhausted&#34;.</li><li>if the person does not have any immigration status or applications pending and is picked up by an immigration enforcement team.&#160;</li></ul><p>It is common for someone at risk of detention to be picked up when they go for their regular reporting/signing event at the Home Office.</p><p>People detained under immigration powers may be detained in an immigration removal centre (IRC) or short-term holding facility, or if they are a foreign national ex-offender who has completed their custodial sentence they may continue to be detained in prison.

The council has a duty to assess as long as there is the appearance of need.

The person's needs must relate to physical or mental impairment or illness, and must not be a result of them being destitute.&#160; The person must be unable to achieve at least two of the following outcomes&#160; and this must have an impact on their wellbeing.&#160;&#160;These outcomes are:<br>- Managing nutrition<br>- Managing toilet needs<br>- Maintaining personal hygiene<br>- Making use of community facilities and services.</li></ul><p>Note that some refused asylum seekers can only get care and support from social services if this is necessary to prevent a breach of their human rights, so social services&#160;will need to carry out a human rights assessment to establish whether support can be provided.&#160; This has three Stages</p><p><b>1. Can they freely return to their country of origin?</b></p><p>Is there an obstacle to returning, such as missing travel documents, illness that means they can&#8217;t fly, outstanding appeal to the HO?&#160;&#160;If there is a temporary barrier, support could be given temporarily until the barrier is removed and reviewed regularly.&#160;If there is an insurmountable barrier to return, refusing support will probably be a breach of HR</p><p><b>2. What would be the impact of return to their Country of origin on their human rights and would they be breached?</b></p><p>In the case of refused asylum seekers, the opinion of the Home Office is usually available (refusal letter detailing why they believe that the person is not in need of protection).</p><p>However, asylum seekers would need to be given the opportunity to seek legal advice to prove that return&#160; would breach their Human Rights.&#160; It is not sufficient to say that no comparable medical facilities exist in the Country of Origin .</p><p><b>3. Impact on family and private life</b></p><div>What social and family ties the person has in the UK and whether these could be maintained.   Right to family life is a relative right and can be breached if proportionate to legitimate public end. <br></div><p><b>MAKING A CARE ACT APPLICATION</b><br></p><p><b>Red Cross&#160;</b>may be able to support asylum seekers in making a Care Act application - see referral form in Printable Resources.</p><p>GPs may refer people for Care Act assessments</p><p><span class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\">&#65279;</span>Requests for a Care Act Assessment on mental health grounds should be made to the <b>Single Point of Access for&#160;<span>adult community mental health services</span></b><br><br>&#8203;<b>CHALLENGING CARE ACT REFUSALS</b></p><p>Legal aid is available to challenge Care Act decisions from solicitors with public law contracts (e.g. Irwin Mitchell).

This can often include feeling lonely, depressed, helpless and with a sense of having lost something. We are all learning new ways of how to pass the time and stay healthy.</p><p><span>There is helpful material with practical tips to help you cope with anxious times translated into a variety of languages available in our printable resources.</span></p><p><span>Psychology Tools have made a useful self help guide with worksheets around living with anxiety available in a wide variety of languages </span><a href=\"https://www.psychologytools.com/articles/free-guide-to-living-with-worry-and-anxiety-amidst-global-uncertainty/\" target=\"\">here.</a></p><p><span>&#183; We all have so many questions about Covid 19 many of which cannot be answered at the moment. It is easy to feel powerless and that everything is out of control.</span><br></p><p>When we feel this, it can be very helpful to focus on what we DO have control over and take each day at a time. We may be surprised and overwhelmed by our feelings, but we can be in charge of what we do each day.</p><p>Here are 4 different ways that we can begin to take control of our daily life and look after ourselves.</p><p>1. Organise</p><p>2. Move</p><p>3. Do Something.</p><p>4. Contact</p><p><b>ORGANISE</b></p><p>&#183; It is important to try and create some structure to your day. We all need some routine in our lives</p><p>&#183; You can decide what time you get up.</p><p>&#183; You can plan what you are going to eat and cook.</p><p>&#183; You can decide when you are go outside</p><p>&#183; You can decide where you will walk to.</p><p><b>MOVE</b></p><p>&#183; We are all allowed to go out to exercise once a day if we are not shielding. We just need to make sure we keep 2 metres apart from people that we are not living with.</p><p>&#183; It is important to exercise to keep your body healthy;</p><p>&#183; If you sit at home and do not go out, your body gives your brain the message that you are helpless and powerless, and this is not true.</p><p>&#183; The most important thing is to MOVE.</p><p>&#183; You can do this at home, but it is important to vary your surroundings.</p><p>&#183; Going out in the sunlight provides us with important Vitamin D and fresh air.</p><p>&#183; You can walk to a park. You do not need to just walk the streets.</p><p>&#183; We can provide you with a list of the parks in the city and the ones near you.</p><p>&#183; We have also designed some walks for you that you can follow. See printable resources.</p><p><b>DO SOMETHING</b></p><p>Using your hands to do something is an excellent way to keep your mind occupied.

Hospitals will be able to provide a face covering in emergencies.</p><p>&#160;If you can, you should also wear a face covering in other enclosed public spaces where social distancing isn&#8217;t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. From 24th July 2020 face coverings will be mandatory in supermarkets and all other shops.&#160;</p><p>You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification.<br></p><p><span>Face coverings do not replace social distancing. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, and/or high temperature, and/or loss of, or change in, your normal sense of smell or taste), you and your household must isolate at home: wearing a face covering does not change this.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Exemptions from Face Coverings</b>&#8203;</p><p></p><p></p><p><span>Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of 3 or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly.&#160;<span>For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. Children under 11 are exempt from wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops.&#160;</span></span></p><p>If someone cannot wear a face covering for medical reasons they can download a travel assistance card which explains this from Travel South Yorkshire. This is available in printable resources. NHS Sheffield has also produced cards that explain why a person is not wearing a mask which can be printed or used on a mobile phone - see printable resources.<br><br><b>Face Coverings and Masks - how to wear them safely</b><br></p><p><span>It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.&#160;</span></p><p>A cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. It can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.<span><br></span></p><p>Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.<span><br></span></p><p>Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.<span><br></span></p><p>You should wash a face covering regularly. It can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent, wash at 60 degrees centigrade. You can also handwash using detergent in hot water - wash by hand for at least five minutes.<span><br></span></p><p>When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.</p><p></p><p>There are guides to wearing face masks correctly in various languages from the World Health Organisation in printable resources.</p><p><b>Anxiety about wearing Face Coverings</b></p><p>This <a href=\"https://happiful.com/how-to-cope-with-face-mask-anxiety/?fbclid=IwAR0gvIxqsP_us9TS4Bax6UhYruXGkidR71lsqj9WECmwyMw-QRq_gjTJCKg\" target=\"\">article</a> on happiful has useful tips and advice regarding anxiety relating to face coverings.&#160;</p><p><b>Accessing Face Masks</b></p><p>Refugees and Asylum Seekers who need a face mask can contact the <b>Migrant Covid-19 support group</b> to request masks provided by volunteers - see service providers for contact details.</p><p>If you provide&#160; a service to Refugees and/or Asylum Seekers in Sheffield and have clients who require face masks you can contact the Migrant Covid-19 support group and be put on a WhatsApp group to request masks when required - see service providers for contact details.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
